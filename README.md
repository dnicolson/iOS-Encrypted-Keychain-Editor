Allows editing of the iOS keychain without a jailbreak by updating the `keychain-backup.plist` file of an encrypted backup.

This repository is a basic React frontend for [irestore](https://github.com/dnicolson/node-irestore) with a simple Node.js backend to stitch together various Keychain pieces. Itâ€™s beyond the scope of this project for now to re-encrypt the whole backup, the encrypted `keychain-backup.plist` file can be added to an encrypted backup with a tool like [iMazing](https://imazing.com/).

Not all Keychain items are editable as `ThisDeviceOnly` items are only able to be decrypted with the hardware `0x835` key which is unique to each device.

This technique was originally developed to allow [signing in to Feedly](https://gist.github.com/dnicolson/73c9f7359db9f61b3621a1e4918aa136) with Reeder 4 on older iOS devices.
